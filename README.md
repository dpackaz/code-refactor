# code-refactor

## Description

This is a landing page created for a marketing agency. When I received the code, there were various omissions and redundancies that needed to be corrected. This provided me with my first real opportunity to debug an application! 

I had lots of trouble with pathing throughout the project, but now that it is all resolved I think that I finally have a solid understanding of it for the future. 

## Installation N/A

## Usage

This is just a simple landing page, but I do want to include a code nippet that I modified -- both to show the code and to practice adding code snippets to a README.

    /*Redundant code consolidated*/
    .benefit-lead,
    .benefit-brand,
    .benefit-cost {
    margin-bottom: 32px;
    color: #ffffff;
    }

    .benefit-lead h3,
    .benefit-brand h3,
    .benefit-cost h3 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    }
