# code-refactor

## Description

This is a landing page created for a marketing agency. When I received the code, there were various omissions and redundancies that needed to be corrected. This provided me with my first real opportunity to debug an application! 

I had lots of trouble with pathing throughout the project, but now that it is all resolved I think that I finally have a solid understanding of it for the future. 

## Installation N/A

## Usage

This is just a simple landing page, but I do want to include a screenshot of some code that I modified -- both to show the code and to practice adding screenshots to a README.
